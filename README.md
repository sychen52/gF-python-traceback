# gF-python-traceback

This is a vim plugin that allow you to gF (jump to file with line number) based on python traceback message in a vim terminal.

Since python's traceback message looks something like: "filename", line xxx, vim's buildin gF does not work. This plugin is to solve it.

It is based on [romainl's answer on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68437027/16999134)

## Install

```vim
Plug 'sychen52/gF-python-traceback'
```
