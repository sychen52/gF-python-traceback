# gF-python-traceback

This is a vim plugin that allow you to gF (jump to file with line number) based on python traceback message in a terminal inside vim.

Since python's traceback message looks something like: "filename", line xxx. Vim's buildin gF does not work. This plugin is to solve it.

It is based on an [answer from stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68428589/vim-gf-command-dont-capture-python-traceback-messages-line-number)
